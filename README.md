# 🌍 Carbon Footprint Tracker with Virtual Pet

## 📌 Overview

This is a React Native Expo app designed to help users track their daily CO2 emissions, gain insights through analytics, and complete tasks to reduce their environmental impact. A **virtual pet** (dog/cat) visually reacts based on the user's environmental habits—thriving when sustainable choices are made and looking sad when emissions increase.

## 🎨 Features

- **Track Daily CO2 Emissions**: Log activities like transport, diet, and energy usage.
- **Insightful Charts**: View cute and engaging visualizations of CO2 impact over time.
- **Task System**: Get personalized tasks to reduce your footprint (e.g., use public transport, eat less meat).
- **Virtual Pet Reactions**: Your pet changes emotions based on your sustainability efforts (happy, sad, angry).
- **Smooth UI with Pastel Green Theme**: A cute and visually pleasing user interface.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
